<h1>OmniLite</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
OmniLite is based on MultiBit, a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) omnicoin desktop client.

<h3>Source</h3>
You can view the full source code on github: <a href="https://github.com/MeshCollider/OmniLite">OmniLite</a>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
All these options are set in the main control file `multibit.properties`. OmniLite looks in a few places for this file in the following order:
<list>
<li> Current working directory when launched. This is for backwards compatibility and for running from a USB drive.</li>

<li> (Mac OS X only) Four directory levels up. This is for running from a USB drive, but outside the OSX `.app` directory.</li>
 
<li> The operating system's standard application data directory:</li>
</list>

<br />
<b>Windows</b>
<br />
* `System.getenv("APPDATA")/MultiBit`<br />
* Example: `C:/Documents and Settings/Administrator/Application Data/MultiBit`
<br />
<b>Mac OS X</b>
<br />
* `System.getProperty("user.home")/Library/Application Support/MultiBit`<br />
* Example: `/Users/jim/Library/Application Support/MultiBit`
<br />
<b>Linux</b>
<br />
* `System.getProperty("user.home")/MultiBit`<br />
* Example: `/Users/jim/MultiBit`
<br />
Wherever this file is found, that directory is used as the application data directory for Multibit.


<h4>Connect to specific peers</h4>

If you want to connect to specific peers set <code>peers=<comma separated list of peers to connect to></code>
<br />
The list of peers can be specified using domain names (`www.myNode.com`) or IP addresses. Example:
<br />
<code>
peers=173.242.119.177, 176.9.42.247, 217.79.19.226, 98.216.173.54
</code>
<br />
(The older property `singleNodeConnection` is still honoured but is now deprecated. Use 'peers' instead).
<br />
Note: ONLY these peers will be used for connections.
